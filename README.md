# RedirectConsoleAppOutput
The RedirectConsoleAppOutput module allows to redirect standard output and standard error of Windows console application in an object in memory. That is its diference from the Start-Process cmdlet which redirects output to file only. If redirecting output to file is enough for your purposes, you don't need this module.
